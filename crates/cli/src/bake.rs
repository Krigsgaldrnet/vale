//! `vale bake`: the WDT, the minimap image and the `MCSH` shadow map that an
//! editor writes, measured against the files the game shipped.
//!
//! ```text
//! vale bake <Map>                          the tiles the WDT claims, and whether
//!                                          each has an ADT behind it
//! vale bake <Map> <x> <y>                  one tile: its minimap redrawn and its
//!                                          MCSH rebaked, each scored against
//!                                          the shipped one
//! vale bake <Map> <x> <y> minimap [<dir>]  the minimap alone, drawn under a
//!                                          sweep of looks
//! vale bake <Map> <x> <y> shadow [<dir>]   the MCSH rebake alone, cast five
//!                                          ways, each scored, with optional
//!                                          comparison pictures
//! vale bake <Map> <x> <y> sun              the default casting scored over a
//!                                          sweep of sun directions
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why the minimap and the MCSH are scored against shipped tiles
//!
//! A terrain edit can be checked by looking at it. A minimap and an `MCSH`
//! cannot: both are images derived from a tile by an undocumented rule, and
//! both look plausible when they are wrong. A minimap mirrored about either
//! axis still looks like terrain, and a shadow map baked under the wrong sun
//! still looks like shadow, falling the wrong way.
//!
//! The 1,500 shipped tiles carry correct images. Each command here generates
//! an image and scores it against the shipped one; no other check is
//! available for either image.
//!
//! ## What a score means
//!
//! A score is not a pass mark. The generators here are not Blizzard's: the
//! minimap draws one swatch per texture layer where the shipped images were
//! rendered from the full textures, and the shadow bake casts from the drawn,
//! alpha-tested doodad triangles and the building collision hulls at
//! `vale_assets::tables::light::SHADOW_SUN`. A high score says the image shows
//! the same place in the same orientation. That is the error that matters, and
//! inspecting a single file does not reveal it.
